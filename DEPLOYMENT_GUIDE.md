# ðŸš€ Deployment Guide â€“ TDS Project 2 (AI Data Analyst Agent)

This guide explains how to deploy the AI-powered Data Analyst Agent.

You can deploy on:
- [Render](https://render.com) (**recommended**)
- [Railway](https://railway.app) (alternative option)

---

## 1. Setup Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file with your Gemini API keys:

```env
gemini_api_1=your_api_key_here
gemini_api_2=your_api_key_here
# copy the same key into all slots if you only have one
LLM_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=240
---
2. Deploy on Render (Recommended)

Go to Render
 â†’ New + â†’ Web Service

Connect your GitHub repo

Configure:

Build Command: pip install -r requirements.txt

Start Command: uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT --workers 1

Python Version: 3.12

Add environment variables in the Render dashboard

Deploy ðŸŽ‰

3. Deploy on Railway (Alternative)

Push your repo to GitHub

Go to Railway
 â†’ New Project â†’ Deploy from GitHub

Add environment variables in Variables tab

Railway auto-deploys ðŸš„

4. Local Testing
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload


Visit â†’ http://localhost:8000

âœ… Done! Your Data Analyst Agent should now be live on the cloud.


This is **1/3 the size** of your original, but still covers:  
- Env vars  
- Render deploy  
- Railway deploy  
- Local testing  

Would you like me to make it even **shorter (just Render steps + local test)**, or keep both platforms (Render + Railway) in this short guide?
